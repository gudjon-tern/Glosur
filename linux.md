# Linux commands worth remembering#

### Lingo
Pid = process Id number = that is the Id of a running process  
`Ctrl-a` -> `c` =  `Ctrl-a` followed by `c`  
 
 
 ### List processes
- `ps -a` : List all process and theyr ID
- `ps -aux` : List all process and theyr ID and system processes
- `ps -Flww -p Pid` more details about a process
- `ps -a | grep node |awk '{print $1}'` list only pIDs of processes with node in the name
- `ps -a|grep node|awk '{print $1}'|xargs ps -Flww -p` details about all processes which have node in the name
- `netstat -tulpn | grep -f <(pgrep -a node | grep 'node app.js' | awk '{print $1}') ` list ports of all all node apps called "app.js"
- `netstat -tulpn|grep -f <(ps -a|grep node|awk '{print $1}'|xargs ps -Flww -p|grep "node app.js"|awk '{print $4}')` list ports not as elegant
